Dividing Line 

A mysterious road splits the landscape into two contrasting realms. 
On one side lies a dense forest with untamed bushes and structures waiting to be explored and demolished. 
The other half reveals a serene landscape adorned with towering trees and sparkling lakes

Findings
- The game is fully playable(can be completed on any succesful generation)
- Sometimes the dividing road wont spawn in the center or anywhere on the map
- Low generation failure rate
- Low count tiles
- Hard Level (not enough cover for base on top side, too much trees/bush)
- Increase enemy max count or decrease enemy spawn delay to make enemies get near to the player faster.
